# Charity Change
A Startup Weekend project in Ruby on Rails for Charity Change, an idea similar to the investing app Acorns which lets users 'round up' purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the rest to charity.

It pulls in registered nonprofits from an API, allowing the user to select one from a searchable list. Data about purchases is mocked, but would theoretically be provided by syncing with a user's bank or credit card provider.
